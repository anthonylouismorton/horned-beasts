## Falsey Values 
- undefined
- '' (empty string)
- null
- 0
- false
- NaN (not a number)

## Comparison operators
a == b 'loose equality' 10 == '10' Value must be the same but type can be different 

a === b 'strict eqaulity' both the type and the value have to be the same 10 === 10

a != b 'inequality' 10 != '10' (this is false)

a !== b 'strict inquality' 10 !== '10' (this is true)

a > b 'greater than' 

a < b 'less than'

a >= b 'greater than or equal to'

a <= b 'less than or equal to'


## logical operators

a && b "and"

a || b "or"

!a "not a" - bang/ opposite day

## Array 
- data type in javascript (typeof object)
- a list of elements - can be made of any type of elements
- `[1, 'pizza', null]` but better practice to store one *type* of data in the array
- in JS we don't have to predetermine the size of array, storage for arrays is non contiguous
- every element in an array has a index(location reference) for where it can be found in the array
- JS arrays are a zero based index system


## loops

### What are they?
- a very common computer science pattern
- a block of code that repeats over and over until a condition changes and is no longer true 

## Why
- save us from having to write the same code over and over
- allow ambiguity
