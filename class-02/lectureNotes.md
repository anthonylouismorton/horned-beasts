## Data types in JAVASCRIPT
- a way of labeling and organizing data
- a way to format data that our program can anticipate and use the data properly

Javascript is a **loosely typed** and **dynamic** language
- loosely typed means that we don't have to know the type of data to declare a variable
- variables do not need to be declared with a type
`let shoe;`

- dynamic meaning I can change the type of data after the variable has been defined

`let shoe = 3`

`shoe = 'pretty'`

## Primitives 
- a data type that cannot be broken down into something more basic

- numbers
  - This is our numberic dt, can be decimals, can be negative... writen with no special notation `12`

- strings
  - a sequence of characters used to represent text... can be letter or other characters like numbers or symbols... denoted with single quotes `'hello'`

- booleans
  - Logical data type, can only be true or false. Use this a lot in validation. denoted with no special notation `true` or `false`

- undefined
  - something that does not yet have a definition
  - `let shoe` 

- null
  - something explictily defined as none
  - `let shoe = null`
